<h1>Typography</h1>

<p><em>Readability</em> is primarily the concern of the typographer or information designer. It is the intended result of the complete process of presentation of textual material in order to communicate meaning as unambiguously as possible. A reader should be assisted in navigating through the information with ease, by optimal inter-letter, inter-word, and particularly, inter-line spacing, coupled with <a href="http://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability">appropriate line length</a> and position on the page, careful editorial “chunking,” and choice of the text architecture of titles, folios, and reference links. Case, whether capital or lowercase, may be pivotal, given the loss of legibility with the use of all caps. However, frequent use of the all-caps style implies that many designers are unaware of the issue.</p>

<h2>Characteristics of readability</h2>

<p>Readability also may be compromised by letter-spacing, word spacing, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading">leading</a> that is too tight or too loose. It may be improved when generous vertical space separates lines of text, making it easier for the eye to distinguish one line from the next or previous line. Poorly designed typefaces and those that are too tightly or loosely fitted also may result in poor legibility. Underlining also may reduce readability by eliminating the recognition effect contributed by the descending elements of letters.</p>

<h2>Purpose of a style guide</h2>

<p>By formulating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide">style guide</a>, a publication (or website) standardizes with a relatively small collection of typefaces, each used for specific elements within the publication, and makes consistent use of typefaces, case, type sizes, italic, boldface, colors, and other typographic features such as combining large and small capital letters together. Some publications, such as <cite>The Guardian</cite> and <cite>The Economist</cite>, go so far as to commission a type designer to create customized typefaces for their exclusive use. Different periodical publications design their publications, including their typography, to achieve a particular tone or style.</p>

<h2>Typeface</h2>

<p>In typography, a typeface (also known as <em>font family</em>) is a set of one or more fonts each composed of glyphs that share common design features. Each font of a typeface has a specific weight, style, condensation, width, slant, italicization, ornamentation, and designer or foundry (and formerly size, in metal fonts).</p>

<p>In professional typography, the term <em>typeface</em> is not interchangeable with the word <em>font</em> (originally “fount” in British English, and pronounced “font”), because the term font has historically been defined as a given alphabet and its associated characters in a single size. For example, 8-point Caslon Italic was one font, and 10-point Caslon Italic was another. Historically, fonts came in specific sizes determining the size of characters, and in quantities of sorts or number of each letter provided. The design of characters in a font took into account all these factors.</p>

<h2>Methods for Pairing</h2>

<p>“One or two typefaces are enough for most designs. When in doubt, a good rule of thumb is to pair a serif and a sans serif. This provides you with what are likely the two most flexible kinds of typefaces, and nearly guarantees you have sufficient variation between the two as they’re inherently different. Obviously, this method doesn’t ensure a good pairing, but it should help you avoid a bad one.</p>

<p>“When it comes to choosing and pairing typefaces, I keep two things in mind: <strong>distinction</strong> and <strong>harmony.</strong> To keep the system you’ve created for visual communication properly balanced, you need to choose typefaces that don’t compete too much with each other, but aren’t so similar as to be indistinguishable. ...</p>

<p>“Creating <strong>distinction</strong> can be as simple as pairing typefaces with strong visual differences ...</p>

<p>“A good way to build a foundation for <strong>harmony</strong> is by finding typefaces with inherent visual relationships in their structure. ... For instance, many typefaces have similar skeletons or strong geometrical foundations based on circles and rectangles. Find two typefaces that share similar shapes, like Helvetica and Bodoni, and pair them together.”</p>
